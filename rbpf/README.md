## Description

This is a fork of [RBPF](https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf) by Quentin Monnet.

This crate contains a virtual machine for eBPF program execution. BPF, as in
_Berkeley Packet Filter_, is an assembly-like language initially developed for
BSD systems, in order to filter packets in the kernel with tools such as
tcpdump so as to avoid useless copies to user-space. It was ported to Linux,
where it evolved into eBPF (_extended_ BPF), a faster version with more
features. While BPF programs are originally intended to run in the kernel, the
virtual machine of this crate enables running it in user-space applications;
it contains an interpreter, an x86_64 JIT-compiler for eBPF programs, as well as
an assembler, disassembler and verifier.

The crate is supposed to compile and run on Linux, MacOS X, and Windows,
although the JIT-compiler does not work with Windows at this time.

## Link to the crate

This crate is available from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/solana_rbpf),
so it should work out of the box by adding it as a dependency in your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
solana_rbpf = "0.8.1"
```

You can also use the development version from this GitHub repository. This
should be as simple as putting this inside your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
solana_rbpf = { git = "https://github.com/solana-labs/rbpf", branch = "main" }
```

Of course, if you prefer, you can clone it locally, possibly hack the crate,
and then indicate the path of your local version in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
solana_rbpf = { path = "path/to/solana_rbpf" }
```

Then indicate in your source code that you want to use the crate:

```rust,ignore
extern crate solana_rbpf;
```

## API

The API is pretty well documented inside the source code. You should also be
able to access [an online version of the documentation from
here](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/), automatically generated from the
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/solana_rbpf)
version (may not be up-to-date with master branch).
[Examples](examples), [unit tests](tests) and [performance benchmarks](benches)
should also prove helpful.

Here are the steps to follow to run an eBPF program with rbpf:

1. Create the config and a loader built-in program, add some functions.
2. Create an executable, either from the bytecode or an ELF.
3. If you want a JIT-compiled program, compile it.
4. Create a memory mapping, consisting of multiple memory regions.
5. Create a context object which will also acts as instruction meter.
6. Create a virtual machine using all of the previous steps.
7. Execute your program: Either run the interpreter or call the JIT-compiled
   function.
