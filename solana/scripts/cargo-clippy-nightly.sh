# Use nightly clippy, as frozen-abi proc-macro generates a lot of code across
# various crates in this whole monorepo (frozen-abi is enabled only under nightly
# due to the use of unstable rust feature). Likewise, frozen-abi(-macro) crates'
# unit tests are only compiled under nightly.
# Similarly, nightly is desired to run clippy over all of bench files because
# the bench itself isn't stabilized yet...
