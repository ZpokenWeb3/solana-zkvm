# There's a special common feature called `dev-context-only-utils` to
# overcome cargo's issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8379
# This feature is like `cfg(test)`, which works between crates.
#
# Unfortunately, this in turn needs some special checks to avoid common
# pitfalls of `dev-context-only-utils` itself.
#
# Firstly, detect any misuse of dev-context-only-utils as normal/build
# dependencies.  Also, allow some exceptions for special purpose crates. This
# white-listing mechanism can be used for core-development-oriented crates like
# bench bins.
#
# Put differently, use of dev-context-only-utils is forbidden for non-dev
# dependencies in general. However, allow its use for non-dev dependencies only
# if its use is confined under a dep. subgraph with all nodes being marked as
# dev-context-only-utils.

# Add your troubled package which seems to want to use `dev-context-only-utils`
# as normal (not dev) dependencies, only if you're sure that there's good
# reason to bend dev-context-only-utils's original intention and that listed
# package isn't part of released binaries.

# 2. Check implicit usage of `dev-context-only-utils`-gated code in dev (=
