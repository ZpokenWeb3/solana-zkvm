/// Invoke a cross-program instruction.
///
/// Invoking one program from another program requires an [`Instruction`]
/// containing the program ID of the other program, instruction data that
/// will be understood by the other program, and a list of [`AccountInfo`]s
/// corresponding to all of the accounts accessed by the other program. Because
/// the only way for a program to acquire `AccountInfo` values is by receiving
/// them from the runtime at the [program entrypoint][entrypoint!], any account
/// required by the callee program must transitively be required by the caller
/// program, and provided by _its_ caller. The same is true of the program ID of
/// the called program.
///
/// [entrypoint!]: crate::entrypoint!
///
/// The `Instruction` is usually built from within the calling program, but may
/// be deserialized from an external source.
///
/// This function will not return if the called program returns anything other
/// than success. If the callee returns an error or aborts then the entire
/// transaction will immediately fail. To return data as the result of a
/// cross-program invocation use the [`set_return_data`] / [`get_return_data`]
/// functions, or have the callee write to a dedicated account for that purpose.
///
/// A program may directly call itself recursively, but may not be indirectly
/// called recursively (reentered) by another program. Indirect reentrancy will
/// cause the transaction to immediately fail.
///
/// # Validation of shared data between programs
///
/// The `AccountInfo` structures passed to this function contain data that is
/// directly accessed by the runtime and is copied to and from the memory space
/// of the called program. Some of that data, the [`AccountInfo::lamports`] and
/// [`AccountInfo::data`] fields, may be mutated as a side-effect of the called
/// program, if that program has writable access to the given account.
///
/// These two fields are stored in [`RefCell`]s to enforce the aliasing
/// discipline for mutated values required by the Rust language. Prior to
/// invoking the runtime, this routine will test that each `RefCell` is
/// borrowable as required by the callee and return an error if not.
///
/// The CPU cost of these runtime checks can be avoided with the unsafe
/// [`invoke_unchecked`] function.
///
/// [`RefCell`]: std::cell::RefCell
///
/// # Errors
///
/// If the called program completes successfully and violates no runtime
/// invariants, then this function will return successfully. If the callee
/// completes and returns a [`ProgramError`], then the transaction will
/// immediately fail. Control will not return to the caller.
///
/// Various runtime invariants are checked before the callee is invoked and
/// before returning control to the caller. If any of these invariants are
/// violated then the transaction will immediately fail. A non-exhaustive list
/// of these invariants includes:
///
/// - The sum of lamports owned by all referenced accounts has not changed.
/// - A program has not debited lamports from an account it does not own.
/// - A program has not otherwise written to an account that it does not own.
/// - A program has not written to an account that is not writable.
/// - The size of account data has not exceeded applicable limits.
///
/// If the invoked program does not exist or is not executable then
/// the transaction will immediately fail.
///
/// If any of the `RefCell`s within the provided `AccountInfo`s cannot be
/// borrowed in accordance with the call's requirements, an error of
/// [`ProgramError::AccountBorrowFailed`] is returned.
