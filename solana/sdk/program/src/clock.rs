//! Information about the network's clock, ticks, slots, etc.
//!
//! Time in Solana is marked primarily by _slots_, which occur approximately every
//! 400 milliseconds, and are numbered sequentially. For every slot, a leader is
//! chosen from the validator set, and that leader is expected to produce a new
//! block, though sometimes leaders may fail to do so. Blocks can be identified
//! by their slot number, and some slots do not contain a block.
//!
//! An approximation of the passage of real-world time can be calculated by
//! multiplying a number of slots by [`DEFAULT_MS_PER_SLOT`], which is a constant target
//! time for the network to produce slots. Note though that this method suffers
//! a variable amount of drift, as the network does not produce slots at exactly
//! the target rate, and the greater number of slots being calculated for, the
//! greater the drift. Epochs cannot be used this way as they contain variable
//! numbers of slots.
//!
//! The network's current view of the real-world time can always be accessed via
//! [`Clock::unix_timestamp`], which is produced by an [oracle derived from the
//! validator set][oracle].
