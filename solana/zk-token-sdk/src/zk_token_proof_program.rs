//! The native ZK Token proof program.
//!
//! The program verifies a number of zero-knowledge proofs that are tailored to work with Pedersen
//! commitments and ElGamal encryption over the elliptic curve curve25519. A general overview of
//! the program as well as the technical details of some of the proof instructions can be found in
//! the [`ZK Token proof`] documentation.
